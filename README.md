# ☕ Java OOP Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java console applications focused on practicing and applying
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles through practical projects.
Each project is organized in its own folder and represents a step forward from basic examples to more
structured, object-oriented applications.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project folder typically includes:

- `src/` directory containing Java source files  
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining the project in detail

## 📌 Included Projects

| Project Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Number_Guessing** <br>(Sayı Tahmin Oyunu) | A classic number guessing game where the user tries to find a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. This project focuses on basic control flow, user input handling, and simple class design. |
| **Adventure_Game** <br>(Macera Oyunu) | A console-based text adventure game developed using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The player explores rooms, interacts with NPCs, engages in dialogues, collects items, and faces enemies within a structured game design. |
| **More coming soon…** | Additional Java projects will be added as the repository evolves. |

## ▶️ How to Run a Project

1. Open the folder of the project you want to run  
2. Navigate to the `src` directory  
3. Compile the Java files (example):


javac com/mycompany/projectname/*.java
Run the main class:


java com.mycompany.projectname.MainClassName
📌 Each project may have slightly different package names or main classes.
Please refer to the project’s own README.md for exact instructions.
